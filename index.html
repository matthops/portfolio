		<div id="about">
			<p> Now, this is a story all about how my life got flipped-turned upside down and i'd like to take a minute just sit right there, i'll tell you how i became the prince of a town called Bel Air.</p>
			<p> In west Philadelphia, born and raised, on the playground is where I spent most of my days.</p>
			<p> Chillin out maxin/ relaxin' all cool and all shootin some b-ball outside of the school, when a couple of guys who were up to no good, started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared she said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air."</p>
